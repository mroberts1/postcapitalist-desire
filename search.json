Later, as the weeks progressed, the decision was made to try and continue the course in Fisher’s memory.\nThe seminar was transformed into a kind of reading group, with the help of a number of Fisher’s friends, colleagues, collaborators, and influences being invited to join students in their discussions of the texts that Fisher had intended to explore.\nThese reconstructed sessions later turned into a more public reading group, under the title “Nothings Into Somethings”, in which some of these same texts were discussed again in a more public forum.1\nThe titles and readings for the following ten sessions are included below, along with readings for the five sessions above.
