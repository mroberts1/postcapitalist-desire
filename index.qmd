Following Mark Fisher’s death on Friday, 13 January 2017, the remaining ten weeks of the “Postcapitalist Desire” seminar did not go ahead as intended.[From Mark Fisher, *Postcapitalist Desire: The Final Lectures* (London: Repeater Books, 2020).]{.aside}

:::

For the first few weeks, students continued to use the seminar room during the module’s scheduled Monday morning time slots to sit together and remember their lecturer. Later, as the weeks progressed, the decision was made to try and continue the course in Fisher’s memory.

The seminar was transformed into a kind of reading group, with the help of a number of Fisher’s friends, colleagues, collaborators, and influences being invited to join students in their discussions of the texts that Fisher had intended to explore.

These reconstructed sessions later turned into a more public reading group, under the title “Nothings Into Somethings”, in which some of these same texts were discussed again in a more public forum.1

The titles and readings for the following ten sessions are included below, along with readings for the five sessions above. This syllabus reflects the original form, content and editions used by Fisher, provided on the contents page of the reader he produced for the course.
