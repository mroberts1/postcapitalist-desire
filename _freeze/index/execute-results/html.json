Later, as the weeks progressed, the decision was made to try and continue the course in Fisher’s memory.\n\nThe seminar was transformed into a kind of reading group, with the help of a number of Fisher’s friends, colleagues, collaborators, and influences being invited to join students in their discussions of the texts that Fisher had intended to explore.\n\nThese reconstructed sessions later turned into a more public reading group, under the title “Nothings Into Somethings”, in which some of these same texts were discussed again in a more public forum.1\n\nThe titles and readings for the following ten sessions are included below, along with readings for the five sessions above. This syllabus reflects the original form, content and editions used by Fisher, provided on the contents page of the reader he produced for the course.\n\n## Lecture One: What is Postcapitalism?\n\n- Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams, “Post-Work Imaginaries” in **Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work** (London and New York: Verso, 2015), pp, 107–127.
